## What is a Guilloche Pattern
Guilloce Patterns, is a mathmatically created pattern, that I personanly think looks very cool. It is most commonly used on the backgroup of money.

These Pattern's are almost impossible to scan/print without noticalble defects. Also, the Guilloce Pattern is easy to make, but very hard to tell which exact curves were used to create the pattern.


## Superformula Curve
To create the Guilloce Pattern you need to first create the curve, this is done with the Superformula.

1) First you set *r* to equal

2) Then you create an parametric equation setting x = r*cos(current) and y = r*sin(current).

## The Spirograph
Using the Superformula, you create to curves. The first curve will act as the path, and the second as the shape. At each point along the first curve, you create the second curve. This will get you the Guilloche Patterns.
